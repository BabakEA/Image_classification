# Image_classification
Computer vision 
Hi 
In this repository, you can find Image classification using the diversion (CNN) method as well as Regression (Random forest, KNN, D3,..) algorithms.
There are two Jupyter files in each folder. You will generate and train a model using the model generator and test the model using the production file.
